<h2 id="2-schedule-changes-reason">2. SCHEDULE CHANGES REASON</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>We had earlier thought of making the basic code working before moving on to designing
traces to be tested. But due to course-staff’s suggestion - “we should work on memory
traces and get them ready before starting to work on the code”, we re-shuffled the order
in which we approached the project. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="3-work-completed">3. WORK COMPLETED</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Till now we have completed the following:
1. Studied about various snooping protocols.
2. Researched whether to use Intel’s pintool or Contech for generating memory traces.
3. Made test programs.
4. Generated memory traces for these test programs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="4-status">4. STATUS</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>We had to reshuffle the order in which we do things for the project. So, according to the
revised order, we are running on schedule. <br />
Yes, we should be able to meet our goals and deliverables. <br />
Nice to haves - we are currently running on time, so should be deliverable in time. <br />
List of goals that we’ll hit for the Parallelism competition includes, analyzing the following
protocols with a “split transaction bus”: <br />
1. MSI <br />
2. MESI <br />
3. MOSI <br />
4. MOESI <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="5-parallelism-competition">5. PARALLELISM COMPETITION</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>We plan to show graphs that we generate after analyzing the performance of the above mentioned protocols.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="6-concerns">6. CONCERNS</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>We don’t have any concerns as of now. Everything is going according to the plan. <br /></p>
