TITLE: Cache Coherence Protocols Analyzer

SUMMARY:
We are going to implement a Cache Simulator for analyzing how different Cache Coherence Protocols perform under varying READ/WRITE scenarios.

BACKGROUND
We will be studying about different Cache Coherence Protocols and will identify the advantage and disadvantages of each protocol. And using this data we’ll try to simulate how each protocol might perform under different traces as compared to the others.

THE CHALLENGE


RESOURCES
We will be writing the code from scratch. And since this is an analysis project, we don’t need any type of performance-specific hardware.
Although, we still need to figure out how to obtain/generate the memory traces.

GOALS AND DELIVERABLES
Plan to achieve:
We plan to do the analysis based on comparisons between the following 4 protocols:
MSI
MESI
MOSI
MOESI
If time permits we will try to add a few more protocols to our analysis results:
Dragon
MESIF
Firefly

We will try to analyse how these protocols respond to various work loads. We will first begin with a fixed system configuration to study the effects of different protocols. And further expand it to make the system configurable for better analysis. 

PLATFORM CHOICE
We will be using C++ as the programming language, as this project mainly involves being able to read the memory traces from input files and dumping them into an output file. This can be easily done in C++.
