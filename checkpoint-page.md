## 1. REVISED SCHEDULE
> Apr 11 - Apr 17 - Study different snooping protocols, discuss how we could enhance the project <br>
> Apr 18 - Apr 24 - Make test programs, use Intel Pintool to generate traces for the test programs <br>
> Apr 25 - May 01 - Implement LRU cache for single processor (less work owing to exams) <br>
> May 02 - May 04 - Add support for cache coherence protocols - MSI, MESI <br>
> May 05 - May 07 - Add additional protocols - MOSI, MOESI, Dragon, Firefly, etc. <br>
> May 07 - May 09 - Prepare analysis report <br>
> May 10 - May 11 - Project Presentation Preparation <br>

## 2. SCHEDULE CHANGES REASON
> We had earlier thought of making the basic code working before moving on to designing
traces to be tested. But due to course-staff's suggestion - "we should work on memory
traces and get them ready before starting to work on the code", we re-shuffled the order
in which we approached the project. <br>

## 3. WORK COMPLETED
> Till now we have completed the following:
> 1\. Studied about various snooping protocols.
> 2\. Researched whether to use Intel's pintool or Contech for generating memory traces.
> 3\. Made test programs.
> 4\. Generated memory traces for these test programs.

## 4. STATUS
> We had to reshuffle the order in which we do things for the project. So, according to the
revised order, we are running on schedule. <br>
> Yes, we should be able to meet our goals and deliverables. <br>
> Nice to haves - we are currently running on time, so should be deliverable in time. <br>
> List of goals that we'll hit for the Parallelism competition includes, analyzing the following
protocols with a "split transaction bus": <br>
> 1\. MSI <br>
> 2\. MESI <br>
> 3\. MOSI <br>
> 4\. MOESI <br>

## 5. PARALLELISM COMPETITION
> We plan to show graphs that we generate after analyzing the performance of the above mentioned protocols.

## 6. CONCERNS
> We don't have any concerns as of now. Everything is going according to the plan. <br>
